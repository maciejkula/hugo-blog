At this year's Europython, I presented a talk on 'Speeding up search with locality sensitive hashing'.

In the talk, I presented the intuition behind locality sensitive hashing and discussed several Python packages for performing approximate nearest neighbour searches (including my own, [rpforest](https://github.com/lyst/rpforest)).

If you are interested in the details, please see my blog post on the Lyst [developers blog](http://developers.lyst.com/2015/07/10/ann/). The recording of the talk and slides are embedded below.
