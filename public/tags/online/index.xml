      <description>MinHash is a simple but effective algorithm for estimating set similarity using the Jaccard index. Both the Wikipedia entry and this blog post are good explanations of how it works.
MinHash is attractive because it allows us to decide how similar two sets are without having to enumerate all of their elements. If we want to know how many users that performed action $A$ also performed action $B$, we can compare the MinHashes of the two sets instead of keeping track of multiple sets of millions of user ids.</description>
