      <description>This blog post originally appeared on Medium
Popular general-purpose auto-differentiation frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow are very capable, and, for the most part, there is little need for writing something more specialized.
Nevertheless, I have recently started writing my own autodiff package. This blog post describes what I’ve learned along the way. Think of this as a poor-man’s version of a Julia Evans blog post.
Note that there are many blog posts describing the mechanics of autodifferentiation much better than I could, so I skip the explanations here.</description>
